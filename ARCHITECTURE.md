Below is a comprehensive plan and architectural outline for developing **AnaTili**, a Django-based quiz application focused on language learning quizzes (e.g., greeting phrases in Kazakh). The plan considers scalability, maintainability, and modularity from the start. It also incorporates ongoing improvement cycles and includes strategies for content management, user engagement, and future enhancements.

---

### High-Level Concept

**AnaTili**: A Django quiz application where:

- Users select a category (e.g., “Greetings,” “Common Phrases,” “Numbers”).
- Users start a quiz session, receive a series of multiple-choice questions, and select one of four possible answers in Kazakh.
- The system scores the quiz and provides feedback.  
- Over time, more categories and questions can be added via an admin interface. 

**Key Features:**

- **User Management**: Basic user registration/login or guest sessions.
- **Category and Question Management**: Admin interface to add/edit/remove categories and questions.
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Each question has exactly one correct answer and up to three distractors.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track user scores, possibly store past results and progress.
- **Scalability & Extensibility**: Easy to add new categories, languages, or content domains.

### Goals and Considerations

1. **Maintainability**: A clean, modular architecture that separates business logic, data models, and presentation.
2. **Scalability**: Potential to handle many categories, large question banks, and concurrent users.
3. **User Experience**: Clear, intuitive UI/UX for starting quizzes, navigating questions, and receiving feedback.
4. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Although the quiz initially focuses on Kazakh phrases, plan for easy adaptation to other languages or language pairs.
5. **Security & Data Integrity**: Ensure secure handling of user data, session tokens, and quiz scoring logic.

### Architectural Overview

The architecture follows standard Django best practices with a modular approach:

**Layers:**

- **Presentation Layer**: Django templates (or a frontend framework if chosen), styled with CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind or Bootstrap).
- **Application Layer**: Django views and Django Rest Framework (DRF) endpoints to serve questions and handle user answers.  
- **Domain Layer**: Models representing categories, questions, answers, and user sessions.
- **Data Layer**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite for development) storing quiz data, user profiles, and results.

**Key Components:**

1. **Models**: 
   - **Category**: `id, name, description, language_code`.
   - **Question**: `id, category(FK), question_text, difficulty_level, is_active, created_at`.
   - **Option**: `id, question(FK), option_text, is_correct`.
   - **UserProfile**: `id, user(FK), preferences` (optional if adding personalized experience).
   - **QuizSession**: `id, user(FK or anonymous), category(FK), start_time, end_time`.
   - **UserAnswer**: `id, quiz_session(FK), question(FK), chosen_option(FK), correct (bool)`.

2. **Views and Controllers**:
   - **Category Selection View**: List available categories.  
   - **Quiz Start View**: Initialize a quiz session for a selected category, randomly fetch a set of questions.  
   - **Question Display View**: Show a single question with four options, handle form submissions or AJAX requests.  
   - **Answer Submission Endpoint**: Validate the user’s choice and record the result.  
   - **Results View**: Display the final score, correct/incorrect summary. Possibly suggest user’s next steps or categories.

3. **APIs (if using a front-end SPA or for future mobile apps)**:
   - **GET /api/categories**: Fetch categories.
   - **POST /api/quiz/start**: Start a session, returns session_id and first question.
   - **POST /api/quiz/answer**: Submit an answer, returns correctness and next question or final results.
   - **GET /api/quiz/results/<session_id>**: Get results after quiz completion.

4. **Templates and Static Files**:
   - Templates for listing categories, showing questions, and displaying results.
   - Mobile-friendly, responsive design. Possibly integrate a simple styling framework.

5. **Business Logic**:
   - **Randomized Questions**: On starting a quiz, randomly select a subset of questions from the chosen category.  
   - **Result Calculation**: Tally correct/incorrect answers at the end of the quiz session.
   - **Option Shuffling**: Shuffle options each time a question is served to prevent memorization by order.
   - **Difficulty Adjustment (Future)**: Potentially adapt question difficulty based on user’s past performance.

6. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - **Basic Users**: Use Django’s `User` model and `auth` system for registered users.
   - **Guest Users**: Support sessions that don’t require registration but store minimal data.
   - Admin access restricted to staff users for creating/editing categories and questions.

7. **Admin Interface**:
   - Utilize Django’s built-in admin to:
     - Add or edit `Category`.
     - Add or edit `Question` and related `Option`s.
     - View quiz sessions and user answers (for analytics).

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the Django project and app structure (`anatili_project`, `quiz_app`).
  - Configure the database (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production).
  - Create the core models: `Category`, `Question`, `Option`.
  - Set up Django admin for category and question management.
- **Outcome**: A working admin where one can create categories and questions, plus a basic homepage to select categories.

**Phase 2: Quiz Workflow**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement `QuizSession` and `UserAnswer` models.
  - Create views and templates for:
    - Category selection page.
    - Quiz start page (initiating session).
    - Question page to display question and options.
  - Implement logic for retrieving next question, validating answers, and storing user’s choices.
- **Outcome**: A fully functioning quiz flow from category selection to final results.

**Phase 3: User Management & Session Handling**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate user authentication (login, logout, optional registration).
  - Store quiz results per user, allowing repeat quizzes, and show past performance.
  - Handle anonymous sessions (store a cookie-based session ID).
- **Outcome**: Users can log in, track their progress, and view their quiz history.

**Phase 4: UI/UX & Frontend Enhancements**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Improve template design, add styling.
  - Make the UI mobile-responsive.
  - Add JavaScript for smoother navigation (e.g., using AJAX to load next question without full page reload).
- **Outcome**: A polished, user-friendly interface.

**Phase 5: Internationalization & Scalability**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Add support for internationalization (i18n) in Django for future language expansions.
  - Optimize database queries and add pagination or caching if needed.
  - Setup proper error handling and logging.
- **Outcome**: A scalable, maintainable codebase ready for multiple languages and larger user bases.

**Phase 6: Advanced Features (Optional/Future)**  
- **Tasks**:
  - Add a leaderboard for top scores or categories.
  - Implement difficulty levels and adaptive quizzes based on user performance.
  - Introduce a “Practice Mode” vs. “Test Mode.”
- **Outcome**: Enhanced engagement and gamification features.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: For models, views, forms, and utility functions.  
- **Integration Tests**: For the quiz flow, ensuring the correct sequence of pages and data flow.  
- **User Testing (Beta)**: Have a few test users try the flow and provide feedback on question clarity, UI, and scoring correctness.
- **Performance Testing**: Check response times and database queries to ensure scalability.

---

### Deployment & DevOps

- **Local Development**: Use Django’s `runserver` and SQLite.
- **Staging Environment**: A small server with a PostgreSQL database and close-to-production settings.
- **Production Setup**:
  - Deploy to a managed platform (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) or on-prem server.
  - Use Gunicorn + Nginx, PostgreSQL, and a static files CDN.
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to run tests on each commit.
  - Regular backups of the database and secure handling of secrets (use `.env` files).

---

### Ongoing Improvement

- **Feedback Loops**: Monitor analytics (which categories are most popular, which questions are often answered incorrectly).
- **Continuous Content Update**: Add new categories and questions through the admin dashboard.
- **Community Involvement**: Potentially invite language experts to suggest new questions or categories.
